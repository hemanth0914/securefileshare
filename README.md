# Secure File Share Application

The Secure File Share Application provides a robust, scalable, and secure platform for efficient file uploading and downloading, utilizing various AWS services. This application ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and adheres to best practices in security and data integrity.

## Overview

This application is designed to handle high volumes of user requests for file storage and transfer. It leverages Amazon S3, EC2, API Gateway, VPC, and AWS Cloud Map to create a seamless and secure file-sharing service.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Amazon S3 Bucket

- **Purpose**: Acts as the central storage for all user files.
- **Features**: Offers durable, highly available storage ensuring data safety and accessibility.

### 2. Amazon EC2 Instance

- **Functionality**: Serves as the operational backbone, handling logic and interactions with the S3 bucket.
- **Security**: Uses an IAM role for secure access without storing sensitive credentials.

### 3. API Gateway

- **Role**: Manages all user requests and serves as the entry point for the backend.
- **Capabilities**: Handles request routing, data transformation, and secure data transfer.

### 4. VPC Link

- **Integration**: Links the API Gateway directly with the EC2 instance via a private IP.
- **Benefits**: Enhances security and network efficiency by confining data flow within Amazon's network.

### 5. AWS Cloud Map

- **Service**: Manages the registration and tracking of application components.
- **Scalability**: Dynamically scales the application by managing traffic routing based on instance availability.

## Workflow

- **User Interaction**: Users interact with the application via a frontend that communicates with the backend through the API Gateway.
- **File Operations**:
  - **Upload**: Files are uploaded through the API Gateway, processed by the EC2 instance, and stored in the S3 bucket.
  - **Download**: Files are retrieved by the EC2 instance from the S3 bucket and sent back to the user via the API Gateway.
- **Scaling and Management**: Handled by AWS Cloud Map, ensuring optimal routing of requests to the best available server instance.
